# a11ytables 0.2.0.9001

* Hotfix: correct spelling error in installation instructions in README (#111).

# a11ytables 0.2.0

## New features

* Allowed the cover information passed to `create_a11ytable()` to be supplied as a list rather than a data.frame, which means you can have an arbitrary number of rows under each section (#102).
* Allowed the user to supply links in Markdown format (e.g. `[GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk)`) when passing the cover information to the `tables` argument of `create_a11ytables()` (#47).
* Allowed the user to supply links in Markdown format (e.g. `[GOV.UK](https://gov.uk)`) when passing the data source reference to the `source` argument of `create_a11ytables()` (#47).
* Added an `mtcars_df2` demo data set that contains a list input for the cover page, which itself contains Markdown-formatted hyperlinks.

## Bugfixes

* Ensured `stringsAsFactors` is set explicitly to `FALSE` in the `data.frame` call within `create_a11ytable()`, given that this default behaviour changed in R version 4 (#85).

## Docs

* Updated the 'a11ytables' vignette given the new features.
* Updated function documentation given the new features.

# a11ytables 0.1.0

## Breaking changes

* Renamed the `new_a11ytable()` function to `create_a11ytable()` (#27).
* Renamed the `create_a11y_wb()` function to `generate_workbook()` and changed the main argument from 'content' to 'a11ytable' (#27).
* Removed the 'table_names' argument to `create_a11ytable()` and instead autogenerate them from the user-provided 'tab_title' (#61).
* Introduced the `blank_cells` argument to `create_a11ytable()` so the user can provide a table-by-table reason for why cells might be empty (#62).
* Adjusted the in-built `mtcars_df` data set to better fit the changes to the functions.

## Bugfixes

* Provided a warning, rather than error, if you don't provide any 'source' argument to `create_a11ytable()`.

## Docs

* Added a vignette to provide an overview of the code underlying the package so that it's easier for developers to contribute (#58).
* Added a vignette to explain the terminology of a spreadsheet, as used in the package (#58).
* Referred to the updated gptables Python package and the best practice spreadsheet guidance on the Analysis Function website (#73).
* Added hex logo (#81).
* Updated README and other vignettes to reflect changes to the function API.
* Corrected various typos.

## Miscellaneous

* Increased test coverage (#63).
* Updated user-input sanitising: it now removes punctuation in 'tab_title', inserts underscores in place of spaces and adds full-stops to blank_cells and source data (#78).
* Consolidated all a11ytable-class-related functioning into `as_a11ytable()` so that `create_a11ytable()` only has to build a data.frame from supplied arguments and apply `as_a11ytable()` to it (#80).
* Added warning for user if the 'blank_cells' argument is provided to `create_a11ytable()` but there are no blank cells in the table, and vice versa.
* Updated content of RStudio Addins to reflect function and argument changes.
* Adjusted default column widths in notes and contents.
* Renamed files in R/ for consistency and clarity.
* Switched to `inherits()` for class detection in `if()` statements.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.90015

* Added and improved warnings and errors (#34).
* Simplified the in-built data set so it matches the 'get started' vignette.
* Updated the gif used in the 'get started' vignette.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.90014

* Added explanations to the accessibility checklist vignette.
* Converted the 'quickstart' vignette to 'get started', used a simpler example, added gif.
* Removed the 'construct' vignette.
* Used 'reference' in _pkgdown.yaml to better separate functions on the site.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.90013

* Added an RStudio Addin to insert code for an {a11ytables} workflow (#54).

# a11ytables 0.0.0.90012

* Made source, notes and table insertion dynamic, so the row of insertion of each is dependent on the others (#33).
* Applied table styling based on dynamic table placement (#33).

# a11ytables 0.0.0.90011

* Prevented the tab title being pasted into the titles of tables sheets (#48).
* Made sure to wrap non-header cells in tables sheets (#41).
* Provided an auto-column-width adjustment in tables where cell content or headers is long (#41).

# a11ytables 0.0.0.90010

* Added warnings if issues are detected when making an a11ytables-class object (#34).
* Added a modified mtcars example data set, `mtcars_df` (#20).
* Expunged `lfs_tables` (#20).
* Added 'Crown Copyright' to authors as the copyright holder .
* Updated README and vignettes given these changes.
* Added new quickstart vignette and simplified README (#43).
* Handled plurals and periods in meta sheet elements, update detection of notes in column headers.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9009

* HOTFIX: corrected `.detect_notes()` so it actually works.
* Converted the `print` method to a `summary` method, as suggested by @TimTaylor (#23).
* Imported {pillar} for {tibble}-style printing, as suggested by @TimTaylor (#26).
* Added @TimTaylor as a contributor.
* Updated vignettes and README.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9008

* Ensured numeric columns (even if they contain a string like '[c]' to indicate a suppressed value) are right-aligned (#32).
* Isolated out `.insert_*()` functions for table count and note presence from `.insert_prelim_a11y()`, for clarity.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9007

* BREAKING CHANGE: removed subtables because they're not being used for now and are confusing.
* Added the first draft vignettes on how to create an a11ytable and an accessibility guidance checklist (#22).

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9006

* HOTFIX: fixed a problem where the `tab_title` was being used to filter when it should have been `sheet_type`.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9005

* BREAKING CHANGE: the user-supplied table for the cover sheet should now be supplied as a tidy two-column data.frame with a row per subsection, with columns for the 'subsection title' and 'subsection body'.
* Updated the `lfs_tables` and `lfs_subtables` example data sets given the above; for an example see `lfs_tables[lfs_tables$sheet_type == "cover", "table"][[1]]`.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9004

* BREAKING CHANGE: switched to using the `sheet_type` column of an a11ytable-class object to infer the sheet type as 'cover', 'contents', 'notes' or 'tables' (replacing 'meta'); it's no longer the `tab_title` that serves this role (#18).
* Ensured styles and `.add_*()` now make internal references to `sheet_type` rather than `tab_title`.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9003

* BREAKING CHANGE: retired fully the `add_*()` function family for building a workbook 'by hand', given the introduction of `create_a11y_wb()`.
* Introduced S3 class 'a11ytable', including exported functions to generate (`new_a11ytable()`, `as_a11ytable()`) and test (`is_a11ytable()`) objects of this class.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9002

* Simplified all `add_*()` functions to a single `create_a11y_wb()` function (moving towards #15), though `add_*()` functions are all still exported.
* Split supplied data into two, with and without sub-table examples: `lfs_tables` and `lfs_subtables`, respectively.
* Updated README to detail simplified approach.

# a11ytables 0.0.0.9001

* Added un-exported `.style_*()` utils functions to style worksheets (#1).
* Incorporated style functions into `add_*table()*` functions.

* Added MIT license with `LICENSE.md`.
